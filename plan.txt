Daily Planner App
Goals:
    1. Using the development of this program to teach myself web app dev basics

App functionalities:
- The app will work like a to-do list of sorts. Daily activities will have checkboxes to be checked or left unchecked. It will use a calendar
    system to lock out checkboxes for days past and in future.
- Will have an app bar on top for access to user profile and main menu.
- the opening page will show the activities of the day, or a link to the page the user will use to update their daily activities list.
- light mode and dark mode
- a milestone and rewards system set by the user.
- a notification system while using the app
- a diary system
- log in and register
- Smooth UI transitions.
